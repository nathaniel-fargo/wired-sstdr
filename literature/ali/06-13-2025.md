> Dear Nathaniel,
> I’ve spent some time researching the feasibility of using Spread Spectrum Time Domain Reflectometry (SSTDR) in power systems, and I’d like to share several key findings and concerns that I believe are important for your consideration before proceeding further with your work. Please read the following points carefully, as they outline several technical and practical challenges that will need to be addressed.

Dear Ali,

Thanks so much for your research and thoughts, I look forward to addressing these concerns and feasibilities. I'll provide a quick response now with my current thoughts and come back later with more research and papers to answer open questions.

> One major consideration is the need for isolated coupling circuits. These are essential for safely injecting test signals into energized power systems. Without such isolation, signal injection can be either ineffective or pose significant safety risks. Additionally, traditional Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) methods are generally unsuitable for live systems due to high levels of electromagnetic interference (EMI), harmonic distortion, and other noise sources. SSTDR addresses these issues through the use of pseudo-random binary sequences (PRBS) and correlation-based signal processing, but this adds new layers of complexity.

First isolated coupling circuits. Your conclusions are correct on the necessity of these for energized circuits. While I haven't studied the specific implementations of this, I know that research has been done to perform SSTDR on live circuits up to 6.7 kVp-p.

I'll upload this to the box but I'll  Additionally, I'm aware of Prof. Furse applying this to lower voltage circuits, up to ~600V or so. 

> Another concern is that certain components, such as transformers, exhibit high impedance to high-frequency signals. As a result, SSTDR signals may not propagate through them effectively, which limits system observability. This means that SSTDR might only be useful on segments of the power system that are electrically continuous and free of such barriers. In fact, two important trade-offs arise when selecting the frequency of the PRBS signal. If we attempt to match it to the power system’s 60 Hz frequency, the signal becomes difficult to distinguish from the power signal, and the rise time becomes too slow for accurate fault localization. On the other hand, using a higher-frequency PRBS improves spatial resolution but suffers from reduced penetration through certain components.

Me and Prof. Furse have been discussing this issue, and are not confident on the level of impact and mitigation strategies. I will due further research, but your insights on this will also be highly valueable. Rocky Mountain Power initially was in contact with Prof. Furse over the scope of the project I am working on. We were planning on visiting one of Rocky Mountain's test beds and measuring signal distortion through their transformers, but they have since become quite busy and we have not found a time to visit them. This will be an issue we'll have to get past, but may also be an advantage in the fact that once we can get our signal on the line, we won't have interference from the circuitry on the other sides of the transformers, since they'll undergo the high impedence. Something we'll have to be thoughtful about. However, we'll likely want to use a frequency much higher than 60 Hz. The amount of resolution we are able to acheive in our measurements is proportional to our frequency (or rather wavelength), and having a frequency of 60 Hz leads our resolution to the order of 1000 miles. Ideally we could operate at the order of 1 MHz. 

> Furthermore, live power systems present additional complications due to dynamic load behavior. Load switching and operational variability can cause legitimate changes in system impedance, which SSTDR could misinterpret as faults. This challenge makes it necessary to compare new reflections against a dynamic baseline—something that may require extensive historical data and possibly machine learning models to ensure accurate fault detection. In contrast, offline or de-energized systems benefit from a static baseline. Once the inherent impedance characteristics are known, it becomes easier to detect deviations that signal a fault.

We have also been in discussions about dynamic load behavior. We agree that we will likely need some sort of dynamic baseline or machine learning model to handle this. Loads will switch throughout the day and will be recognized as impedence changes. I'm curious what the effect of transformers will have on this—at high frequencies will transformers reduce the impact of downstream loaded changes on distribution network, or not. I'm also curious about the de-energized systems, because while an initial assumption about a static baseline makes sense, I also am not confident that different conditions (such as what is attached to the power network and what state those loads are in) will not also affect de-energized systems. 

> Regarding system modeling and simulation, I believe we should eventually explore the use of a commercial SSTDR device in a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) configuration. However, without this setup in place, it does not appear feasible to directly integrate a real device with a software-based simulation. Please let me know if you believe otherwise or find a documented example of someone who has successfully done so.

This HIL setup would interest me too, and is what we were hoping for if granted access to Rocky Mountain Powers testbed grid. That seems uncertain though so we'd love to proceed without it. I'm a bit confused on "it does not appear feasible to directly integrate a real device with a software-based simulation." Are you refering to a setup in which the distribution signals are actually generated via digital software simulation and we have a real SSTDR device in place? If so, I agree that's not feasible. I still hope we can have a purely software based simulation run our system (not realtime) and produce results. 

> Additionally, I have some technical uncertainties about modeling SSTDR behavior in MATLAB or Simulink. For example, I am unsure how to generate PRBS signals with rise times comparable to those produced by FPGAs. One potential approach could involve using a current source in Simulink that is controlled by a signal defined in the MATLAB workspace, but I’m not yet confident in the viability of that method. Another option might involve pulse generators. Either way, before proceeding, I would like you to investigate whether anyone has successfully implemented this approach and, if so, how they did it.

I would like to know more about the Simulink simulation. I will do some investigation, but as far as I'm aware Simulink is very flexible in terms of operation and I think I will need to know more about the specific libraries, tools, or codes you are using to simulate your grid. Pulse generators make more sense to me than current sources, but further discussions will be needed. 

> Moreover, we need clarity on how the signal processing aspect is handled in MATLAB. Specifically, is fault detection based on a simple subtraction from a baseline waveform, or does it involve more advanced techniques such as correlation, filtering, or AI-based interpretation?

I think we should start with the simple case of known faults in a simulated network and comparison using baseline subtraction, but in a real application I think these more advanced techniques will be necessary and we'll have to do continuous research and thought as we go. 

> To help move forward, please search for and review any studies involving the application of SSTDR or TDR in either energized or de-energized power systems, especially beyond coaxial cable or aerospace contexts. I’m particularly interested in any research involving practical setups using Simulink or MATLAB. If you find relevant work by Professor Parvania or Professor Cynthia Furse, please include it as well. Once you’ve gathered those papers, upload them to the Box folder and provide a brief explanation for each—specifically outlining how they address the concerns I’ve raised above.
> As an example, I have already come across this paper:

> As for my own contribution, I am happy to model a power circuit in Simulink using simple components. I can also assist in applying machine learning techniques, either for adaptive baseline detection or for more advanced pattern recognition based on SSTDR reflections. However, I urge you to address the questions and concerns I’ve outlined here before we invest further time into implementation.

I look forward to your contributions to this project and am very grateful for your help and knowledge.
