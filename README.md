# Nathaniel Fargo WIRED Research

Under Cynthia Furse, this research is part of the WIRED fellowship. LiveWire technologies, SSTDR, WILMA, and other technologies will be used as part of this project to develop and test techniques for fault and disruption analysis on power grid networks.

*This work was presented at the WIRED Symposium 2025 in Calgary, CA and won Best Poster*

You may find this work on either the [U of U GitLab](https://git.eng.utah.edu/u1460339/wired-sstdr) or on my [personal github](https://github.com/nathaniel-fargo/wired-sstdr)

## Disclaimers
1. Dr. C.M. Furse is a co-founder of LiveWire Innovation/Viper Innovation which is commercializing SSTDR technology, and therefore she is disclosing a financial conflict of interest with this company.
2. Much of this code was written with assistance from LLM agents. It may be assumed that any sufficiently large matlab file was partially written by such coding assistants.
