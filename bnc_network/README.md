### BNC Network Experiments

This workspace holds hardware experiments on branching power networks and their LiveWire measurements. Start with `branch_tests/` for the 18-branch depth-of-detection analysis and `cable_measurements/` for per-cable logs.

- `branch_tests/README.md` — Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the analysis figure and intermediate CSVs.
- `branch_tests/scripts/` — MATLAB utilities for drawing networks, pairwise comparisons, and plotting trend vs. baseline.
